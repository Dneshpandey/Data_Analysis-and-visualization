# Data_Analysis-and-visualization
Data analysis and visualization with python utilizing Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.
TaxiCab is your neighbourhood friendly Taxi service making your life easier to commute through the busy streets of New York City. Since it began operations in 2019, the taxi service has really picked up and has become the number one service to use in NYC.
The main goal of this project is to analyze and visualize the provided dataset and draw the possible insight.
This project was completed using the jupyter notebook for Python 3 web-based interactive computing platform.Several libraries are used, including pandas and numpy. Visualization is also done via seaborn and matplotlib.
Many libraries, such as Dtale, can directly give a large number of visual details on a dataset. However, in this challenge, I did not use the built-in tools to offer a complete analysis.
**Please note that this project can be done with visualisation tool such as Power BI, Tableau.
